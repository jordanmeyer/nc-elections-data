# NC Elections Data
Data and starter maps for an NCData4Good project aimed at educating NC voters.

## Data
Most data are from the [State Board of Elections](http://www.ncsbe.gov/) and can be found in their [public data directory]( http://dl.ncsbe.gov/index.html).

The data files used in maps/voters.R are too large to store on github. See the 00-get-the-data.R file for the functions to download these files.

## Maps
Some example maps used to validate the data gathering and cleaning process.
