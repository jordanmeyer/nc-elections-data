# NC Elections Data
Data and starter maps for an NCData4Good project aimed at educating NC voters.

## Data
Most data found at the [State Board of Elections](http://www.ncsbe.gov/) [public data directory]( http://dl.ncsbe.gov/index.html).

Some of the data files are too large to store on github. See the 00-get-the-data.R file for the commands to download these files.

## Maps
Some example maps used to validate the data gathering and cleaning process.
